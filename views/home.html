				<h1 class="blog-title">The Colors of Photography
					<p class="date">8/6</p>

					<i>Black and white are the colors of photography. To me they symbolize the alternatives of hope and despair to which mankind is forever subjected.</i>
				</p>
				<iframe id='iframe' src='//flickrit.com/slideshowholder.php?height=400&width=600&size=medium&speed=5&setId=72157656478886968&credit=1&thumbnails=0&transition=1&layoutType=fixed&sort=0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' width='600' height='410'></iframe>
				<p>
					My variation on Robert Frank’s quote is light and dark as the colors of photography. 
					<br><br>
					My project looks at the drama created by light and dark. We know that dramatic light can exaggerate the importance of things. With this in mind, I created photos where the light and shadows thrust unexpected surfaces and angles of objects into prominence. Not only unusual surfaces and sections, but unusual objects themselves, were presented in the context of dramatic lighting.
					<br><br>
					When the light side of the moon emerges from empty space, it evokes a sense of placelessness. In this project, objects emerge from the darkness and their location is subsequently ambiguous and mysterious. Light and shadow abstract the picture, compared to a scene lit by daylight, where all things seem to exist in the same world together.
					<br><br>
					I’ve been fascinated with the moon since I was little. In recreating the visual features of the moon, I hoped to achieve in recreating some of the ways watching the moon at night made me feel. Isolation, grandeur, timelessness, pensivity and mystery.

				<p>
					In the future ppl will have complete access to their life history the way we have access to info on Google. We  will be able to query not just certain times of our life, but filter based on other data we track such as dopamine, pain, and specific experience we calibrate the sensors to pick up. The sensors will be stupid, it will be like a camera just reading in all the light data without any cleaning. Then we can use computing to distinguish which parts of our life we feel joy ------by comparing to our emotions now. "What other times of my life did I feel this way?"
					<br><br>
					All subjective experience can be  shared.  We can say, these are all the time you had a similar experience to this other person is feeling right now.
					<br><br>
					Technology and data can help us understand ourselves better by allowing us to query our lives and compare with the lives other people choose to share.
					<br><br>
					We need a better way to interact with the Internet---my fingers hurt.
					<br><br>
					We still see our digital lives and online presence as distinct from our biological selves. This will be less and less the case in the future.

				<p>
					It’s always good to ask a random person “what do u think of this song.” 
					<br><br>why?<br><br>
					it’s not because their perspective is always right. or if the notion of right when it comes to taste even makes sense. ultimately your own taste is the arbiter. but you can expand your taste honestly. You can ask, what does this person really feel when they listen and like this song? What do I hear that they don’t hear that makes them not like this song?
					<br><br>
					If there perspective is something that you can connect with, dwell on it a little more. let it grow on you. how often did you dismiss an artist to quickly? dwell on it Especially if a lot of people think the same way—it must be a strong force coming from our common soul.
					<br><br>
					COMMON SOUL

				<h1 class="blog-title">No Boring Moments 
				<p class="date">3/20</p>
				</h1>
				Common Room was a good song when I finished the first version. But it got boring. When I let my friends listen to it, I would say "wait for this part", almost as to excuse the material that we were currently listening to. You can conceive of a rap song as having verses rapped over a repeated beat with a chorus separating each verse. If this is it--no matter how good the verse, beat or chorus is, if the beat and chorus stay the same the song will get tiresome. That's where switchups, new layers, modulation, and exposition come in.
				<br><br>
				But keep it together. If you use a piano riff here, use it again later but develop it slightly differently. Was it an ornamentation before? Then use it as a rhythmic piece. Experiment with the cadence of beats by starting beats on off beats or looping segments. Break the monotony of the four-bar phrase by taking out the last two bars and developing the harmonies in a different direction. Add a sound effect that reflects the social/environmental context to give the song a broader soundscape. 
				<br><br>
				All these techniques can be used to make sure there are no boring moments. Four minutes is a lot more time than people are willing to give to a random stranger. If you are trying to impress a girl you can lose their interest in much less time. And you only have the auditory sense to hook them--they aren't going to spend time looking at colors or savoring flavors. Since time is the space music occupies, make good use of it and don't waste it.

				<h1 class="blog-title">Challenging Music 
				<p class="date">3/19</p>
				</h1>
				Kendrick Lamar's <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> came out this week, and of all the different receptions from audience and critics, one characteristic everyone agrees on is that the album is challenging. So I want to ask the question: What does it mean for a piece of music to be challenging?
				<br><br>
				I'm not talking about conceptually challenging, because that definition is easy and obvious. Something is conceptually challenging when it is dense with meaning and the message is abstruse. When it tackles various philosophical views and contains contradiction, allusion, etc. What I want to define is how music can be challenging. What is it about the post-funk bebop production of <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> that makes it musically challenging, which subsequently delights critics and alienates some less devoted listeners (and reaffirms the loyalty of other listeners).
				<br><br>
				Avoiding basic scales (including harmonies and modulation), syncopated and unpredictable changes in rhythm, musical dissonance, the (lack of?) groove, conflicting styles (smooth jazz with trip hop). The least challenging songs in the musical sense are the songs that lend themselves to the radio: King Kunta, These Walls, Alright, Blacker The Berry, I. The most challenging include Wesley’s Theory, For Free?, u, For Sale?, Hood Politics, Complexion, You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said), How Much A Dollar Cost. 
				<br><br>
				I stress that when I say some songs are not as challenging-I don’t mean they are less complex, interesting, beautiful, intelligent, or great. I mean they are the songs that, if you showed a Kendrick dilettante—someone unaware of the social context and musical history—the person would not like them as immediately, if at all. I also stress that this does not mean this person has a lesser understanding of music. You can say that these “challenging” songs are less universal and less intuitive, which can be the hallmarks of the best kind of music (Let It Be, Beethoven’s Ninth).
				<br><br>
				Is challenging music better music? I’m not sure but I have a gut feeling the answer is no. What I do know is that it can be less popular, more appreciated by the academic type, and at times more rewarding. It can also be less elegant, less emotional, less appealing.

					Jesus would not have been in a secret society. He did not exclude anyone and loved all. He would have torn those fucking walls down. But what would he say about the gates that we put up to exclude the rest of New Haven? Maybe Yale is like a big secret society, and the benefit of being in this one is the police will crack down on drug dealers and beggars in front of Woolsey and cast them down the street so that, unlike Jesus, we won’t have to walk with prostitutes.

				<p>
					I always think of music as having three layers. Of course this ignores the complexity and entanglement of music, but I often use this framework heuristically and find it useful so I am sharing it here.
					<br><br>
					The three layers are the Literal, the Emotional, and the Aesthetic.

					The first layer is the most accessible. In a song, it is the semantics—the literal and metaphorical meaning of the words. This is the realm of description, ideas, concepts and the play of concepts. Many rap fans enjoy wordplay and story telling, so they dwell in this first layer.  This is the message of the song. This is the political statement. This is cerebral part.  
					<br><br>
					This is the layer where a lot of people (unfortunately) stop. I’ve heard people say I’ve one too many times, “I want the lyrics to mean something, otherwise I won’t enjoy the song.” 
					<br><br>
					Yes. If you don’t think too much about what you are listening to, it is easy to stop here and not go further. People focus their attention on this level because it is the most accessible. It is the easiest to talk about, because we have the language to talk about it. “It” is itself manifested in language. When asked to explain why you like a song, it’s most easy and direct to say “I liked it because it told me a story” or “I liked what it was trying to say” and then go on and describe what it was trying to say. Since we have the language to talk about it, we talk about it the most, and subsequently many people take it as the most important aspect.
					<br><br>
					It should be noted that a lot of music ignores this first layer and only concerns itself with the second and third. A good example is the body of Western classical music.  Every piano concerto number X or symphony Y declares even in the name (or better yet lack of name) that it does not care about the literal level and will do all its work somewhere else in the music.
					<br><br>
					The second layer is the Emotional. This is simply how the song makes you feel. There is an incredibly important distinction between this layer and the Literal. I can sing lyrics about how sad I am, but the words themselves cannot carry sadness. The words have to refer to something—indirectly, such as talking about an experience, or directly, such as saying “I’m sad”—to convey sadness. Words and language refer to things that will make you feel an emotion but themselves are symbols with no emotional content. The beautiful thing about music is that the music itself conveys emotion. 
					<br><br>
					Music is especially effective and recreating an emotional state in someone.
					<br><br>
					A chord itself can make you feel happy or sad. Here we isolate the music from semantic content, and find it still conveys emotion. The way to test this theory is to listen to music in a different language. You don’t have to understand the lyrics (the first layer) to receive the emotional content—it’s conveyed in the rhythm, melody, harmony, expression, etc. That’s the power of music.
					<br><br>
					It is not very hard to talk about emotions in music at a superficial level. We have the pump-up song in the gym, the chill song, the club banger, a patriotic national anthem, the nostalgic folk song, the sublime religious piece. These are all words to describe various emotional states. It is not hard to talk about because these emotions are so common we’ve developed words for them! That’s what language is for after all.
					<br><br>
					HOWEVER, what is difficult to talk about are the emotional nuances after digging a little bit deeper into how a song makes you feel. This level takes a more artistic sensibility, although to an extent is understood by everyone. How much of a “banger” is it? Does something feel corny? What part? The artistic process of crafting a song to make you feel a certain way, to isolate a melody or a chord change in a song that creates this emotion, becomes more and more challenging as it becomes subtler and more subjective.  It’s the job of the artist and the audience to be able to tell the difference and appreciate these different emotional levels even when there are no good words to describe them!
					<br><br>
					If you noticed a trend, it might be that each layer becomes less accessible and more subjective.  Part of the goal in writing this post is to remind us how important and intrinsic the deeper layers are. 
					<br><br>
					The last is the Aesthetic layer. What is this layer? It’s all the qualities of music that are about music IN AND OF ITSELF. It’s kind of like the second layer as in it makes you feel something, but I would not call that feeling an emotion. It’s the feeling when you look at the color green with the color orange, or some other random combination. There is not a conventional emotion such as happiness or sadness, but there is definitely an aesthetic impression. 
					<br><br>
					This is an amazing layer for me because the aesthetics of music penetrate so much more than the aesthetics of anything else—visual art, poetry, etc. (This is just me though! I am not saying this is everyone. I’m sure if you a visual artist, you will say the same thing about visual art). When you hear some type of chord change or melody, even without changing my concepts (first layer) or my emotional state (second layer), it will still affect me and strike me deeply if it is amazing. A lot of academics in music study this and try to create a language for it. They call it Form and study harmony and modulation. My opinion is that it might be entertaining to create a language for all of this and try to describe interesting relationships and patterns and innovations that come out of it, but the real meat of aesthetics is the ineffable AESTHETIC feeling you get when you hear it. I think understanding theory and form will help allow you to point out when something beautiful or aesthetic happens, but it won’t explain why it’s beautiful, AND it won’t explain what it is, since what it is only understood by hearing it and nothing else. There is really nothing more talk about here. I’ve gone off the deep end trying to put this layer into words.
					<br><br>
					That’s it. Three layers. All important, but not equally accessible (or important).

				<h1 class="blog-title">Objectification 
				<p class="date">2/9</p>
				</h1>
				<p>
					What does objectification of women mean? This is a topic I've struggled with: struggled to understand and struggled to agree with. I formerly thought that it is not a bad thing to talk about someone's objective qualities. For example, Lebron James is my hero since I was eleven. I always talk readily about him objectively: "he's 6'8", "he is an athletic monster", "he has incredible finesse, court vision, power etc". I did not see why in itself it is a bad thing to admire or desire someone's objective traits--or even more plainly, their physical attributes. The same goes for traits about women. When I say you have long hair, or pretty eyes, I am indeed regarding you objectively but I am not for one moment of the belief that you are less of a person or have less autonomy than anyone else. I argued that just because you are talking about one's objective traits does not mean you are DENYING or stripping them of their subjective ones.<br><br>
					This is the point to which I have opened my eyes today. Yes, logically, talking about someone's objective traits and appearances does not negate their subjectivity. The problem is not logic, it's context. Context, history, experience, implication. From a male's perspective, it is easy to say one does not necessistate the other. From a female's perspetive, someone who concerns himself with a female's objective traits and is silent about her as a person oftentimes corresponds with a lack of respect or concern for the woman. We have a long history of portraying women as prizes and as dependent. We have a prevelant culture where we demean and disrespect women. 
					<br><br>
					So to summarize, I see objectification not as pointing out someone's objective traits, but doing so AND denying one's personhood. Due to culture, history, and everyday experience, silence on the latter can be construed as denial.
					<br><br>
					<h1 class="blog-title">Offense</h1>
					Is something wrong if it offends people? <br><br>
					Let's take Big Sean's IDFWU. He is talking about a specific person in his life who he feels wronged him. I believe he is not talking about women in general, but rather just express his experiences with one particular woman. Many people disagree, however. Many people are offended, which makes me ask the question: if people are offended, does it make the thing wrong? 
					<br><br>Let's take two scenarios. In scenario A, a person makes a statement that he believes is right and few people are offended. In scenario B, a person makes a statement that he believes is right and many people are offended. The only thing that has changed is the number of people taking offense. From the person's perspective, what he is saying is in line with his principles and beliefes (this is a postulate of the thought experiment). But does the fact that many people are offended change the morality of the situation? What is he to do if he wants to voice his opinion and be a good person?
					<br><br>What I mentioned above is a general case to which I do not have the answer to. A more particular case I have been thinking about is the subject of women in rap lyrics. Particularly, the objectification of women. A good friend of mine brought up somethign while I was showing her a song of mine: although my intentions were not to degrade women (nothing could be farther from the truth, it was a song celebrating love), when people hear the song they can perceive it as someone putting down women. After thinking about it much more, I've come to the conclusion that in this particular case, the consequence of lyrics is not only that people differ philosophically (in which case, if I felt my argument and beliefs were correct I would defend my right to say it). The consequence is that it may perpetuate a certain culture or attitude that treats women negatively. It may bring up bad experiences and relationships. I am all for bringing up bad experiences: I make a lot of dark music to expose and explore all our emotional states; I think bad experiences are a part of the human experience. But for a song about love and sex and sung from my perspective, the affect I want it to have on listeners is one that is unequivocally positive and supportive.

				<p>
					When I was 14 I knew I wanted greatness. At that time, with that upbringing and education, my idea of greatness was getting into an ivy league. At least I knew that was the first step, I had some notions about came after, but I told myself once I got in, the rest would work itself out. I worked singularly towards this goal to make my print on the world. <br><br>Once I got in, I realized I earned myself a ticket on a train to the "educated elite." I could ride this train into finance or law. 
					<br><br>Then I read Steve Jobs' biography. I realized there is another destination way higher up, one that you couldn't reach by train. The journey starts somewhere at the bottom of the mountain, but the mountain's base is so wide you might go up half your life to only realize you climbed the wrong side.
					<br><br>
					I ditched my train ticket. I know how valuable it is. Actually I can't even fathom what that ticket would mean to so many people in the world looking for a way out. But my life is short and the earth is vast, and I want to have looked out at it from the mountaintop.

How can you strive for success when the major factors that determine it are luck, popularity and "getting to the right people." Do you stand on a corner and hand people your mixtape? I only have questions in this post since I have absolutely no answers.

				<h1 class="blog-title">What is Good Writing? 
				<p class="date">2/2</p>
				</h1>
				<p>
					Asking "What is good writing?" is to me the same thing as asking "what are the goals of writing?", because for an instance of X to be a "good" X, the instance must achieve the defined goals of X (think Aristotelian ethics). For example, this hammer is a good hammer because it allows a person to push a nail into wood with great lot of ease and efficacy.<br><br>
					I think writing has three ends: meaning, clarity, and style. Different types of writing place different emphasis on each. News journalism stresses mostly the first two, while poetry concerns itself mostly with the third (and in many cases also the first). <br><br>
					I think structrue and form matter for writing insofar as they serve the three ends above. I think structrue for its own sake is an arbitrary principle, and it probably comes from us confusing means with ends. <br><br>
					You might ask why I include style. Isn't the whole point of writing to convey information (meaning) effectively and efficiently (clarity)? I say that is mostly the point; however, the artist in me sees beauty as an end in itself. For me, beauty is a goal always and everywhere.

					Consider an Asian boy who becomes a doctor because he was told to by his parents. Or consider someone who joins a frat and goes into finance because that's what the group was doing and was part of the culture he grew up in. Consider a teenager who joins a gang in the hood because that was what his peers were doing and it gave him a sense of identity and community. I have the same level of respect for all these different people: very little respect. <br><br>I think there are two kinds of people (obviously it's a spectrum, but these are the two poles). People who are determined by their circumstances and people who rise above them. The reason I am as critical of the Asian doctor as I am of the gang member is because if the former became a doctor due to a lack of independent thinking and weakness in character or a missing sense of self, he would have become a gang member had he been born in different circumstances. And I believe you cannot criticize someone due to her circumstances. Thus, I treat them as the same person.
					<br><br> We are not better people because of what situation we were born in. We are better people DESPITE the situation, or even further, in the face of the situation. We rise above our circumstances and uphold our individuality by evaluating the status quo for ourselves and choosing our own beliefs and values.

				From my experience, getting what I want doesn't make me happier. That's probably because I want so much, and no matter what I accomplish there is so much more I want to get done now and far into the future. I think that's OK, as long as I seperate my happiness from my ambition. I will continue to strive and fail, but I will try to be happy all the way throughout. I think happiness is an attitude with which you approach success and failure, rather than a consequence of success and failure. Otherwise, you won't be able to hold on to happiness very long.

				Life's a joke. It's up to you to make it funny.

				<h1 class="blog-title">Young Thug</h1>
				Young Thug embodies the Western classical music ideal of what music is. The classical music tradition, especially that of the Beethoven, Brahms Schoenberg lineage, draws the distinction between programmatic music and absolute music, and champions the latter. Program music is a 19th century term used to categorize music with an extra-musical narrative. The name derives from program notes on the back of concert programs during from era. Absolute music is non-referential music. Music that is not about anything, with no extra-musical meaning. Music for its own sake.
				<br><br>
				Think about a painting: the colors are composed in a way that reminds you of a landscape with rivers and sky, and that subsequently brings you pleasure. Music is different (according to this tradition). The "colors" of music don't RELATE to anything. If you play a C major chord, the effect is immediate and non-referential. Think about a Mozart piano concerto. These aren't named anything because they aren't ABOUT anything; they don't MEAN anything (when I talk about meaning here in the same way someone asks "What does the painting mean?" or "What is the painting about?"). It's music for its own sake, and the form (the arrangement of notes played in time) itself is beautiful. 
				<br><br>
				Which brings me to Young Thug. The objection I hear ALL the time is "what is he even saying??" From the perspective I just described above, this question doesn't matter what bit. It's not the CONTENT of what he's saying. It doesn't matter what it's ABOUT, because that's not what makes music beautiful anyways. It's the COLORS of the music itself that makes the music beautiful: the composition of the timbre of his voice, the melody, the cadence.
				<br><br>
				This actually brings me to a bigger point about rap music. The classic objection is "I don't like what the rapper is saying." Maybe the lyrics are banal, uninspired, whatever. From the perspective of absolute music, it doesn't matter. It's about music, not meaning.
				<br><br>
				Sidenote: I am NOT saying lyrics don't matter. I am saying they don't HAVE to matter. Some rappers are more like poets, in which case of course the meaning of the lyrics matter. But some rappers are purely musicians. Young Thug is an excellent, ground breaking musician.

				The only thing you are entitled to in life are your feelings. That includes music taste, preferences, self-pity, pride, depression. Remember when you got rejected? You aren't entitled to having him or her. But you ARE entitled to the feeling of rejection and allowing yourself to feel pain. Most things in life come from outside of you and are given to you buy chance (or seemingly desert, but in the long run still chance). What comes from within are your emotions and over those you are lord and owner.

				I guess you have to ask what makes something art in the first place. I think something is art based on what its ends are; for art the end is beauty. 
				<br>When Kyrie Irving break someone's ankles with a double hezzy, or when Lebron get an easy fastbreak and instead of the straightforward layup you go for a massive 180 dunk, you're end includes beauty and dopeness and you are an artist. So when the end is strictly to win, basketball is not art. When the end is to play beautifully, it is art. Of course basketball is a combination of the two. Perhaps the former is a higher priority.

				Every new medium of writing or visual art is a chance to throw away traditions, arbitrary conventions and rules, and get back to basics. Movies to theater. Recorded music to classical/performed music. Web blogs, forums and tweets to books. Unrestrained by the paradigm of the former medium, the new medium gets right down to what people want. This blog is a part of that evolution. I'm fighting the tendency to make it in the mold of a newspaper or traditional writing forum. I want it to be my thoughts in real time (which is why I plan to use web sockets). I want it to be a stream of consciousness.

It's like a scroll, a stream.

ETC ETC. The final design of the projects page condenses all these ideas. It flattens three dimensions onto two but somehow keeps some of the mystery of perspective. michael said it was amazing but confusing. katie said it was absurdly beautiful. My ideas sucked at first but i kept brainstorming. I stretched my brain and tried different roads that were crazy and led to nowhere. got it late night stripping away a lot of the extra and focusing on the essential. An artificial restraint can be a starting point. For me it was to keep it one page.
