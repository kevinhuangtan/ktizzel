var quotes = ['An artist is made not by his craft but by his ends: Beauty, Expression, Dopeness',"He plays with a rage that's not very common",'Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom','Music is my Bully Pulpit',"There have been several Duchesses of Westminster. There is only one Chanel","A dreamer finds his way by moonlight, and his reward is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.", "For me, music and life are all about style","The truth of a thing is in the feel of it not the think of it"]
